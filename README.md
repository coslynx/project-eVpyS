# Recipe App

This project is a recipe app that allows users to search, save, and share recipes easily. Users can create personalized profiles to save favorite recipes and access them later. The app will have a vast database of recipes categorized by cuisine, dietary restrictions, and cooking time. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients they already have. Each recipe will include detailed instructions, ingredients list, and nutritional information. Users can rate and review recipes to help others make informed decisions. The app will feature a meal planner where users can schedule their meals for the week. Integration with grocery delivery services to add ingredients directly to shopping carts. Users can create shopping lists based on selected recipes or manually add items. A feature to adjust serving sizes and automatically calculate ingredient quantities. Option for users to upload their own recipes to share with the community. Incorporate a feature for users to take photos of their dishes and share them on the app. Implement a feature for users to follow other users with similar taste preferences. Include a cooking timer within the app for convenience while following recipes. Integrate a feature to suggest recipes based on user preferences and search history. The app will have a user-friendly interface with a clean design for easy navigation.
